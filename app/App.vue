            h1 Substitute
            p Overall, the question to think about here is this: What can I substitute or change in my product, problem or process? You should think about substituting part(s) of your product or process for something else.

        div(v-if="prompt=='combine'") 
            h1 Combine
            p The overall question to think about here is: How can I combine two or more parts of my product, problem, or process so as to achieve a different product, problem, or process to enhance synergy? Creative thinking involves combining previously unrelated ideas, products, or services in order to create something new and innovative.

        div(v-if="prompt=='adapt'") 
            h1 Adapt
            p Overall, the question you need to think about is: What can I adapt in my product, problem, or process? Think about which parts of the product or process you could adapt so as to solve your problem.

        div(v-if="prompt=='modify'") 
            h1 Modify #[span (Also Magnify and Minify)]
            p Overall, the question you need to focus on is this: What can I modify or put more or less #[a(href='https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/emphasis') emphasis] on in my product, problem, or process? Can I change the item in some way? Can I change meaning, colour, motion, sound, smell, form, or shape? Itâ€™s time to magnify or exaggerate your idea, product, problem, or processâ€”or to minify it. These questions will give you new insights about which components are the most important ones. Think about changing part or all of the current situation or product. Alternatively, distort the product in an unusual way.

        div(v-if="prompt=='put'") 
            h1 Put to Another Use
            p The overall question to consider here is this: How can I put the thing to other uses? What are new ways to use the product or service? Can I reach out to other users if I modify the product? Is there another market for the product? Itâ€™s time to work out how you may be able to put your current product or idea to other uses and purposes.

        div(v-if="prompt=='eliminate'") 
            h1 Eliminate
            p Your overall question to consider here is: What can I eliminate or simplify in my product, design, or service? Think of what might happen if you were to eliminate, simplify, reduce, or minimise parts of your idea. If you continue to trim your idea, service, or processâ€”you can gradually narrow your challenge down to that part or function that is most important.

        div(v-if="prompt=='reverse'") 
            h1 Rearrange #[span Or Reverse]
            p Overall, you have to ask yourself this question: How can I change, reorder, or reverse the product or problem? What would I do if I had to do this process in reverse?

        p.spacer
        p Boost your creativity with the randomised SCAMPER technique. Inspired by my very own box of SCAMPER cards: #[a(href='https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/198258/thinkpak-by-michael-michalko/') Creative Thinkpak]
        p.smaller How is this similar to Thinkpak? It uses the Thinkpak "Random Strategy" where you draw a card (one of the SCAMPERs) at random, then try to apply the questions to your problem. I think looking at a random prompt instead of going through the entire SCAMPER list constrains you, which can be a good prompt for thinking outside the box. If it's not applicable, randomise again. Rinse, repeat until you're satisfied with the ideas you've come up with. (What this misses are the "Evaluate" cards, but at this point I suggest you purchase your own *pak* ðŸ˜€ )
