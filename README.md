# Intro

Boost your creativity with the randomised SCAMPER technique.

Inspired by:
- My very own box of SCAMPER cards ([Creative Thinkpak](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/198258/thinkpak-by-michael-michalko/))
- [Interaction Design Foundation, Learn How to Use the Best Ideation Methods: SCAMPER](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/learn-how-to-use-the-best-ideation-methods-scamper)
- [MindTools SCAMPER](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newCT_02.htm)

How is this similar to Thinkpak? It uses the Thinkpak "Random Strategy" where you draw a card (one of the SCAMPERs) at random, then try to apply the questions to your problem. I think looking at a random prompt instead of going through the entire SCAMPER list constrains you, which can be a good prompt for thinking outside the box. If it's not applicable, randomise again. Rinse, repeat until you're satisfied with the ideas you've come up with. (What this misses are the "Evaluate" cards, but at this point I suggest you purchase your own *pak* ðŸ˜€ )
