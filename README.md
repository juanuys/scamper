# Intro

Boost your creativity with the randomised SCAMPER technique.

Inspired by:
- My very own box of SCAMPER cards ([Creative Thinkpak](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/198258/thinkpak-by-michael-michalko/))
- [Interaction Design Foundation, Learn How to Use the Best Ideation Methods: SCAMPER](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/learn-how-to-use-the-best-ideation-methods-scamper)
- [MindTools SCAMPER](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newCT_02.htm)

How is this different? When you're stuck, instead of asking ALL 7 questions, just ask one random question.

This constrains you, which can be a good prompt for thinking outside the box.
